# KAN-Clustering
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) Clustering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a novel clustering method that leverages the unique capabilities of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). Unlike traditional clustering techniques, our approach uses KANs to learn complex, non-linear mappings of data, enhancing the clustering performance by capturing intricate patterns in the data. KANs utilize spline functions for learnable activation, allowing for more flexible and accurate modeling of data distributions.

The project involves an iterative process where the KAN model is used to extract meaningful features from the data, which are then clustered. These cluster assignments are subsequently used to refine the KAN model. This cycle of feature extraction and clustering aims to progressively improve the representation of data, leading to more accurate and interpretable clustering results.

The ultimate goal is to provide a robust and scalable method for unsupervised learning and clustering, applicable to a variety of datasets and domains. This project also includes comprehensive preprocessing steps, model evaluation, and testing to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

## Project Status: Under Development ðŸš§

### Welcome to the KAN Clustering Project!

We are thrilled to have you here, and we invite you to join us on an exciting journey as we develop a clustering method using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This project is currently in an active development phase, and we are working diligently to push the boundaries of unsupervised learning and clustering.

### What's Happening Now?

Our team is deeply engrossed in refining the core components of the KAN clustering methodology. Here's a glimpse of our current focus areas:

1. **Innovative Model Design**: We are designing and implementing the KAN architecture, which leverages spline functions for learnable activation, aiming to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data. This model promises to revolutionize how we approach clustering by providing more flexibility and accuracy.

2. **Robust Data Preprocessing**: Data is the backbone of our project. We are meticulously cleaning and preprocessing datasets to ensure that our model receives high-quality input, thereby enhancing the reliability of our clustering results.

3. **Iterative Clustering and Refinement**: Our method involves an iterative process where we extract features using the KAN model, apply clustering, and use these cluster assignments to further train the KAN. This iterative cycle aims to progressively refine both the features and clustering results.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation and Testing**: We are committed to ensuring the robustness and effectiveness of our method. Our current efforts include rigorous testing and evaluation of each component to guarantee the highest standards of performance.

### Future Plans

As we continue to develop this project, here are some exciting features and milestones we are aiming to achieve:

- **Enhanced Scalability**: Ensuring that our method can handle large-scale datasets efficiently.
